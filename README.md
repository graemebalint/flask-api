# flask-api

Test out the API here: http://graemebalint.pythonanywhere.com

**Endpoints:**
1. /getall
2. /getrandom
3. /searchbylocation
4. /searchbyid
5. /add
6. /deletebyid
7. /deleteall

**Instructions:**

1. If you're unfamiliar with API endpoints and want to test out this program, open the test link in your browser and then paste in 1 of the endpoints. For exampple, http://graemebalint.pythonanywhere.com/getall
2. I recommend testing /getall or /getrandom. The other endpoints require user input and the syntax may feel complicated.

**Project goals:**

1. Mess around with Flask.
2. After playing around with the requests library for a bit, I starting wondering how to build my own API. That's when this project started. The random database is taken from an introductory Python course I enrolled in.
